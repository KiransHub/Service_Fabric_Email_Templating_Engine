# Service Fabric Email Templating Engine
A .NET Core email templating engine build on Service Fabric using Microsoft's Razor engine to send automated emails.

I'm intending this project to be used as part of a wider contract management system where I can manage roles/leads recruiters and contracts but Rome wasn't built in an evening.
